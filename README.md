### My Process
1. I created a wireframe to show a simple quiz with questions, answers and a button for the score.
2. I started by Googling trivia games to understand what was out there for a simple quiz structure.
3. I used some of the sample code and started building. Using one function to house other functions was very helpful as well as using loops to iterate through the question and answer options.
4. Takeaways: I learned a lot during this project about JavaScript and how functions, loops and objects interact. There are so many different ways to accomplish one task. I also need to commit my changes more often.
5. My biggest struggle was making things in JS function. I still struggle to create code from the top of my head so using resources and input from the instructors and team mates really helped.
